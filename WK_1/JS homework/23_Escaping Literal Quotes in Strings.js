//Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings
//Use backslashes to assign a string to the myStr variable so that if you were to print it to the console, you would see:

// I am a "double quoted" string inside "double quotes".
var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
