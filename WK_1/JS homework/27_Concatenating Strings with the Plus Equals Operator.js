//Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator
//Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: This is the first sentence. and This is the second sentence. using the += operator. Use the += operator similar to how it is shown in the example. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = 'This is the first sentence. ';
myStr += 'This is the second sentence.';
