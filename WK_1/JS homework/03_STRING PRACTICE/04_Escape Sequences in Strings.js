//Escape Sequences in Strings
//Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.

// FirstLine
// \SecondLine
// ThirdLine
// You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.

// Note: The indentation for SecondLine is achieved with the tab escape character, not spaces.

var myStr = 'FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine'; // Change this line
